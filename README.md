# HiveMatrix Core

Authentication service and JWT token manager for HiveMatrix.

Core's job is to handle authentication flows working with Keycloak:
- **Token Exchange** - Converts Keycloak tokens to HiveMatrix JWTs
- **Session Management** - Tracks active sessions with revocation support
- **Token Validation** - Verifies JWT signatures and expiration
- **Service Registry** - Maintains list of available services for Nexus
- **Public Key Distribution** - Provides JWKS endpoint for JWT verification

Core works with Keycloak to authenticate users, then issues HiveMatrix-specific JWTs that services use for authorization.
